    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All purpose flour</li>
      <li>Baking powder</li>
      <li>A pinch of salt</li>
      <li>Granulated sugar</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Unsalted butter</li>
      <li>Vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt,
        and sugar, creating the foundation of your pancake batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and then add the milk, melted butter,
        and vanilla extract. Stir until the wet ingredients are well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently fold the wet ingredients into the dry mixture, ensuring a smooth
        batter. Be careful not to overmix, as a few lumps contribute to the
        pancake's fluffiness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat a griddle or non-stick pan over medium heat and lightly grease
        it with butter or cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a ladle or measuring cup, pour the batter onto the hot griddle,
        forming round pancakes. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then
        flip and cook the other side until golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stack the pancakes on a plate, creating a tower of pillowy goodness.
      </li>
    </ol>
